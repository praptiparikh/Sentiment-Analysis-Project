# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using NLP and machine learning. This project focuses on building a sentiment classification system that analyzes text data and determines whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative. The workflow includes importing and cleaning the dataset, preprocessing text using techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization, and training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The model is then evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. The system provides reliable predictions and demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to understand user opinions and automate text classification tasks.
